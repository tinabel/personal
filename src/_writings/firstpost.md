I've been on a journey to find a new graphics tablet lately, one that started when my trusty Monoprice tablet started glitching out when the wire is positioned _just so_. It's more than a few years old and I haven't always been as kind to it as I should be, so that's expected. The glitchiness aside, I've been thinking about buying a screen tablet simply so that I can look at the strokes I'm making _while_ I'm making them, instead of doing the whole scribbling while looking at a completely different surface routine that I've been doing for over a decade.

## Requirements

### Price

Like just about anyone who works with images, I've drooled over those _huge_ Cintiq monsters that take up an entire office desk. They're amazing looking and just scream "I will make you a better artist!". Of course they're lying -- it won't make you a better artist, but it is just so damned pretty. It's also expensive: at upwards to $1,899 for the 27 inch display and $999.95 for the 13 inch display, you're going to be dropping a lot of cash for a Cintiq. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not willing or, to be honest, able to pay that much for a graphic tablet.

### Space

Sure, in a perfect world, I'd have the desk space for a monstrously sized display. In this world, I have a tiny little corner desk with enough room for my imac, a keyboard, and a medium-sized tablet. Granted, this helps out a bit with the price requirement, since I can't **fit** the larger, higher-priced tablets on my desk, but it's still a requirement. I need something less than 20 inches, or I'm not going to have room to work. Could I get a monitor arm? Sure, but I'm hesitant to do so because of the third requirement...

### Mobility

I don't always work in a desktop setting. Sometimes I travel, sometimes I just want to veg on the couch and make some art, sometimes I'm squeezing some work in while waiting for a kid to get done with orchestra rehearsal. That means that I need a tablet that will allow me to pick it up and take it with me. I can't do that with a huge 22 inch tablet. I also need to be able to power it with a USB cable, since sometimes finding a power source is just not in the cards.

### Quality

I need something that will work and work well. I need to know if I'm going to spend my first week of ownership calibrating everything within an inch of its life, or if I'm going to have buyer's remorse over the amount of

## Research

The problem with looking for a screen tablet is the huge amount of research that I'm compelled to do in my search for just the right one. Sure, I could drop the money for a Cintiq, except that I can't. I'm sure they're fabulous and all that, but I can't justify spending that much money on a tablet right now. Even the five-hundred -dollar budget that I've put myself on merits serious consideration, since I'm not keen on spending even that much money (and let's be honest, that's quite a bit of cash). Since I'm already a bit of a research junkie and have decades of experience falling through rabbit holes, I figured I'd post about the sites I found most helpful during this whole process.

I've found a few really trustworthy sources in my search for the perfect (ish) tablet. One is [Brad Colbow](http://bradcolbow.com/reviews), who's a local artist, designer, and general good guy. His reviews are based on personal experience and, while he gets some of the tablets he reviews for free because he's a very lucky and hard-working dog, he spends some time using them to really give a thorough take on what's good and bad about each device he features.

Another excellent source I've found is [Parkablogs](https://www.parkablogs.com), written by Teoh Yi Chie. I don't know Chie, but he seems like a pretty good guy and a great reviewer. His review are informative, he doesn't rely on video for all his reviews (sometimes a body just wants to read instead of watch and listen), and he reviews for multiple operating systems. This was important, since I work within the Mac ecosystem and need to know how devices work with macs.

And finally, YouTube. I'm not even going to link to it, because everyone knows it. This has the _most_ reviews of all, but it can be time-consuming to sift through all the "unboxing" videos to get to experience-based reviews. Yes, the tablets are pretty coming out of the box, but I want to know if they're actually good.

## Decisions

This will be short: I haven't made one yet. Sure, I've narrowed it down quite a bit with my requirements and budget, but I still have more contenders in the arena than my wallet can handle. I've narrowed my choices down to the [Artisul D13](https://us-shop.artisul.com/shop-all/artisul_lcd/artisul-d13/), the [XP-Pen Artist 13.3](http://www.xp-pen.com/goods/show/id/202.html), the [XP-Pen Artist 16](http://www.xp-pen.com/goods/show/id/187.html), and the [Huion Kamvas GT-156HD](http://www.huion.com/pen_display/GT-156HD/). All hit the portable and size requirements, and seem to hit the quality requirement according to reviews. I'm waiting until the dreaded Black Friday to make a purchase, to maximise on the price requirement. I'll post an update when I finally decide and buy.
