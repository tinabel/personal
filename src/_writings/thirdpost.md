title: Buying a Graphics Tablet -- Revisited
summary: I finally decided to take the leap on Thanksgiving (US) day and bought a tablet. After a ton of research, much deliberation, and a lot of discussion (sorry, friends who had to listen to me talk about this and obsess over the past few months), I bought a Huion GT-191. Not the coolest sounding name, but this tablet is pretty nice.

I finally decided to take the leap on Thanksgiving (US) day and bought a tablet. After a ton of research, much deliberation, and a lot of discussion (sorry, friends who had to listen to me talk about this and obsess over the past few months), I bought a Huion GT-191\. Not the coolest sounding name, but this tablet is pretty nice.

One fabulous thing about it is the ability to draw directly _on_ the screen. It's really helped me with detailed work, which has been indescribably nice.

I haven't found paralax to be a problem, but color calibration was difficult. I finally found a good compromise for my color calibration, which means that I have to sometimes check my main monitor to ensure that my work isn't too dark on either screen.

I sacrificed on requirement: portability. This tablet is too big to really be portable. I'm still fine with this, because it forces me to settle down and really concentrate on what I'm doing. For those times when I'm away from my tablet, I've still got my old non-video tablet (just gotta fiddle with those wires), but I've found that I can concentrate on other things instead, like my trusty sketchbook.
