# Hi, I'm Tina.

I'm a full-stack software engineer who specializes in building web applications. I'm passionate about creating software that is accessible, functional, and beautiful. I'm currently based in the United States.

I believe that the web is for everyone and write code with that belief in mind.

## Main technologies

While I use a lot of different languages, I like to find the right tools for the job. That said, my sweet spots tend to be JavaScript (in many various flavors), HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

## Where can you find me?

My professional experience is listed on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinabellvance). For non-programming endeavors, you can find my artwork at [bellvance.com](https://bellvance.com), and on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/tina).
